Hey Guys,
		
		
	+++ may be in some systems windows may say that this installer is dangerous but 100% it is SAFE +++

This Lazy_Listener(v 0.9) made by me 
					i.e	 _@grpnpraveen(github)😎😎😎😎😎   		and  			_@Adult Engineering (youtube channel)😘😘😘😘
 

				+++ points to remember ++++
⁜Just run the installer

⁜ There will be no shortcut generated so you have to open the application directly

⁜ Remember user name will be asked only once (when you open application for first time)

⁜ If you want to change the username open username.txt and type your name(available only for  present version)

⁜You will be asked to select ___MALE (or) __FEMALE VOICE

⁜There are two options to listen to the files ,they are local(need to enter entire path) and online files

⁜ while entering the path remember to enter like shown in the below example
				
				for_example: 
					enter--------->C:\Users\xxxx\Desktop\folder_name\xxx.txt

⁜Also you can listen online  stories (using websites like:-------->  http://textfiles.com/stories/	)
								
				for_example:
					 enter -------------->http://textfiles.com/stories/3wishes.txt  (STORY OF THREE WISHES)

⁜ Also,Once you run this application your history will be saved as mp3 ---------->( last played file will be stored as ----->  History.mp3)
				so,it will be easy to listen last played file again ...👍👍
